# Shemver

Shemver (from Shell and SemVer) is a command-line application to
inspect and manipulate version numbers in the [Semantic Versioning
(SemVer) format][SemVer]. It is written for POSIX shell, making it
compatible with nearly all modern Unix operating systems without the
need for compilation.
